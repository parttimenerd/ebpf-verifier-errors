# A Collection of eBPF Verifier Errors

eBPF verifier errors can be cryptic and are often hard to understand.
So how can we help new developers when they encounter them?
Let's collect verifier error messages, their code context, 
and how they can be resolved.
This collection can then be searched by others and used
as a data source for tooling.

The errors are collected in the form of 
[issues](https://github.com/parttimenerd/ebpf-verifier-errors/issues) to this
repository.

## How to submit?

Just [create an issue with the "New Verifier Error" issue template](https://github.com/parttimenerd/ebpf-verifier-errors/issues/new?assignees=&labels=submisson&projects=&template=new-verifier-error.md):

verifier issues, please open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/parttimenerd/ebpf-verifier-errors/discussions)

We're happy for any issues template improvements or additions
of tools that use the data.
